Here is a selection of them: </p>\n<p><strong>Barack Obama, US president: </strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong></strong>“We know that this moment fills Cubans — in Cuba and in the United States — with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.”</p>\n<p><strong>Vladimir Putin, Russian president:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>“This strong and wise man always looked into the future with confidence. He embodied the high ideals of a politician, citizen and patriot who wholeheartedly believed in the cause, to which he devoted his life. Russians will always cherish his memory in their hearts.”</p>\n<p><strong>Donald Trump, US president-elect:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>“Today the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.” </p>\n\n<promo-box><promo-title><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Fidel_Castro\">Death of Castro</a>\n</p></promo-title><promo-headline><p>\n</p></promo-headline><promo-image><content data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"9ac41358-b3ad-11e6-0878-3636030bc964\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\"></content></promo-image><promo-intro><p><content id=\"df51e576-b449-11e6-961e-a1acd97f622d\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\">Death fuels uncertainty at home and abroad</content>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<content id=\"a8a15cb6-b406-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\">Instant Insight: Climax to year of extraordinary change</content>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p><content id=\"a78f8812-c467-11e2-9ac0-00144feab7de\" title=\"www.ft.com\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\">Obituary: Fidel Castro, 1926–2016</content>\n<br/>\n</p>\n<p><content id=\"555932d2-b3bf-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\">Fidel Castro dies aged 90\n</content>\n</p></promo-intro></promo-box>\n<p><strong>Narendra Modi, Indian prime minister: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>“Fidel Castro was one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century. India mourns the loss of a great friend. I extend my deepest condolences to the government &amp; people of Cuba on the sad demise of Fidel Castro. May his soul rest in peace.”</p>\n<p><strong>François Hollande, French president: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>“Fidel Castro was a great figure of the 20th century. He embodied the Cuban revolution, including the hopes and disappointments that it generated.” </p>\n<p><strong>Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelan president:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>“Fidel Castro was an example of the fight for the peoples of the world. We’ll go forward with his legacy.” </p>\n<p><strong>Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexican prime minister:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>“Fidel Castro was a friend of Mexico, and encouraged a bilateral relationship between the two countries based on mutual respect, dialogue, and solidarity.” </p>\n<p><strong>Justin Trudeau, Canadian prime minister:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>“Fidel Castro was a larger than life leader who served his people for almost half a century.

The UK will continue to work with the government of Cuba on a wide range of foreign policy priorities, including on human rights.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission</strong>: </p>\n<p>“Fidel Castro was one of the historic figures of the past century and the embodiment of the Cuban Revolution.

Strange to hear all the tributes in the news today.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jacob Zuma, president of South Africa:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>“The Cuban people, under the leadership and command of President Castro, joined us in our struggle against apartheid.”</p>\n<p><strong>Jon Lee Anderson, who is working on a biography of Castro:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>“Fidel will inevitably be seen as a kind of crucible for this incredibly tumultuous and epic period we’ve been through, and it will take some time before we’ve truly assess his role in it, but he was truly major. He was the lightning rod in a sense for the idea of revolutionary change in the post-colonial world.”</p>\n<content data-embedded=\"true\" id=\"9ad88574-b3ec-11e6-0878-3636030bc964\" type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\"></content>\n<p><strong>Timoleón Jiménez, leader of the Farc, the Marxist guerrilla group in Colombia:</strong> </p>\n<p>“One of the great men of America and the world has departed.

We should lament only that he had so long to inflict misery on Cuba and beyond. Don’t rationalise or apologise for Castro’s decades of brutal repression, torture, and murder.
