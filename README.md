## Introduction

UPP Service that forwards mapped content collections to the content-collection-rw-neo4j. 
If a 200 answer is received from the writer, it retrieves the elements in the collection from 
the document-store-api and places them in Kafka on the Post Publication topic so that notifications 
will be created for them.

Dependencies are:
1. content-collection-rw-neo4j
2. document-store-api
3. kafka

        --kafka-proxy-address="http://localhost:8080"                                            Addresses of the kafka proxy ($Q_ADDR)
        --kafka-proxy-hostname="kafka"                                                           The hostname of the kafka proxy (for hostname based routing) ($Q_HOSTNAME)
        --kafka-authorization=""                                                                 Authorization for kafka ($Q_AUTHORIZATION)
        
        
3. Test:

Create a file with the following content collection contents:

      {
        "uuid": "45163790-eec9-11e6-abbc-ee7d9c5b3b90",
        "items": [
          {
            "uuid": "d4986a58-de3b-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6"
          },
          {
            "uuid": "d9b4c4c6-dcc6-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6"
          }
        ],
        "publishReference": "tdi23377744",
        "lastModified": "2017-01-31T15:33:21.687Z"
      }


Assuming that the file you just is `cc.json`, you can run the following curl command to test the unfolder

      curl -X PUT --data "@cc.json"  localhost:8080/content-collection/content-package/45163790-eec9-11e6-abbc-ee7d9c5b3b90

If you've setup everything correctly, you should receive a `200` response. You can also watch the app logs for errors as the
unfolder will return a `200` even if kafka related processing fails.

## Build and deployment
_How can I build and deploy it (lots of this will be links out as the steps will be common)_

* CI provided by CircleCI: [content-collection-unfolder](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/content-collection-unfolder)
* Built by Docker Hub on merge to master or on any pushed tag: [coco/content-collection-unfolder](https://hub.docker.com/r/coco/content-collection-unfolder/)

## Service endpoints

### PUT

Using curl:

    curl -X PUT --data "@cc.json"  localhost:8080/content-collection/content-package/45163790-eec9-11e6-abbc-ee7d9c5b3b90

The expected response is a simple `200` with no response body. In case a error takes place, a json response body will be provided,
similar to the following example:

    {"msg\":"Something bad happened"}
    
As a rule of thumb, the unfolder will return the exact response status code and body received from the **content-collection-neo4j-rw** app in
case a non `200` response is received.

The flow of the unfolder is the following:

1. the PUT request is received and is forwarded to the **content-collection-neo4j-rw** 
2. the response from the RW app is evaluated, if it is not a `200` response, the writer response is sent to the unfolder client
3. in case the collection type is not one that needs unfolding (at the moment only `content-package` is unfolded), a `200` response is returned
4. all the UUIDs from content collection as resolved using the **document-store-api**
5. for each piece of content retrieved from the DSAPI, a new message is created and placed on the configured **kafka** topic

## Healthchecks
Admin endpoints are:

`/__gtg`

`/__build-info`

`/__ping`

`/__health`

There are following checks are performed when the `/__health` is called:
1. **content-collection-neo4j-rw** connectivity check
2. **document-store-api** connectivity check
3. **kafka** connectivity check and topic existence check

The `/__gtg` endpoint will return a `200` in case all above health checks are successful.
